# Probability to Goal

Question
-
There is a game board with “n” spaces from the starting point to end point.

You are going to roll a 6-faced dice and move forward the same number of spaces that you rolled.

Please implement a program that calculates how many possible ways are there to arrive exactly at the finishing point.
